## Mindblowing Fact
In today's world, developers can create stunning, professional-quality videos entirely through code. This project is a testament to that capability, showing how modern tools and frameworks have revolutionized video creation.

## Project Journey
This project was initially coded by Lovable website to take it up the ground fast, then downloaded and using Windsurf editor (sometimes Cursor) made what was required. The entire video was vibe coded within 2 days using Windsurf - a shoutout to the amazing team behind this incredible editor! 

## How it Works
The video is created using several powerful concepts:
- **Frames**: Each moment in the video is represented as a frame, allowing precise control over animations and transitions
- **Interpolation**: Smooth transitions between frames are achieved through interpolation, creating fluid motion
- **Remotion**: A powerful framework that enables video creation using React components and JavaScript

## Technologies Used
This project is built with:
- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Remotion (for video creation)
